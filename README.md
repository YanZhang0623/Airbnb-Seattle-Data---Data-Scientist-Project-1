# Data-Scientist-Project-1
Motivation:

For this project, I was interest in using Seatle Airbnb data to find useful information that will help the future visitor to find better place to stay with reasonable price.

The questions I iunterested in are:
  1. What is the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
  2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
  3. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb lisings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
  

Install:

This project requires Python 3.x and the follwing Python libraries installed:

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. MatPlotlib
4. Scikit-Learn
5. Seaborn
6. Datetime

File Description:

1. Data: *listings.csv. *Calendar.csv. * reviews.csv
2. Jupyter notebook file with solution.

Conclusion:
1. The vibe of each neighborhood can be described by the words we found in reviews.
2. The busiest time of the year to visit Seattle is in Auguest and the rental price is about $30 higher than January
3. Both Airbnb lisings and Total Airbnb visitors to Seattle har been increased during the past years.

Summary of results:
The results of the analysis are summarised in a blog posted here: https://medium.com/p/30383c878881/edit
